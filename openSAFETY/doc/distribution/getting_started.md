# Content of package {#sect_package}

The openSAFETY source code distribution contains the \ref page_stack package, as well as various libraries for the use of developing an openSAFETY enabled device.

After extracting the sources, the following directory structure is being presented to the customer

    .\build
    .\cmake
    .\contrib
    .\doc
    .\src
    .\changelog.md
    .\licenses.md
    .\readme.md
    .\version.txt

* **build** - This directory is used for building tools and running cmake, please refer to \ref sect_build for further steps
* **cmake** - This directory contains distribution specific cmake scripts, and should not be altered in any way.
* **contrib** - This directory contains distribution specific scripts, and should not be altered in any way.
* **doc** - Here the software documentation as well as images are being stored (not the actual documentation). Refer to \ref sect_build_doc for instructions on how to generate a new documentation.
* **src** - This directory contains all sources, as well as the openSAFETY stack. Refer to \ref page_source


# Prerequisites and Requirements {#sect_build}

The build system for the distribution is based on a CMake (http://www.cmake.org) build system for allowing cross-plattform tests and builds. It also automatically includes the pre-certification check for the openSAFETY stack. For this check, a current Pyhton installation (http://www.python.org) is needed.

To build the openSAFETY libraries and tools, additionally LibXML (http://www.xmlsoft.org) is needed for building the \ref page_osdd support library.

The documentation is built using doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org). Graphics for the sourcecode documentation are being generated using the dot tool, which is part of the graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org) package.

The following lists the necessary versions and requirements for openSAFETY development:

**Only running pre-certification checks and Stack unittests**:

* CMake Version 2.8.12 or higher (http://www.cmake.org)
* Python Version 2.7.6 or higher (http://www.python.org)

**Generating support libraries**:

* LibXML Version 2.9.x or higher (http://www.xmlsoft.org)

**Generating the API documentation**:

* Doxygen Version 1.8.6 or higher (http://www.doxygen.org)
* Graphviz Version 2.36.0 or higher (http://www.graphviz.org)

**Supported compiler version**:

* All GCC-based version starting with 4.1.0
* Cygwin and MingwSys ports of GCC

**To Note:** The MSVC compiler may not be able to generate unittests correctly
and therefore is not supported with this distribution.

# Generating the documentation {#sect_build_doc}

To generate documentation in HTML format with doxygen, carry out the following
steps:

From the source-code directory in the build subdirectory, execute the following
with a fresh install of the openSAFETY SDK sourcecode:

~~~{.sh}
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_OPENSAFETY_DOCUMENTATION=ON -DUNITTEST_ENABLE=OFF -DBUILD_OPENSAFETY_PYTHON_TOOLS=OFF ../src
make help
~~~

This will display a list of available build commands, among them the following target:

    ... doc

The documentation can be generated by calling

~~~{.sh}
make doc
~~~

and will then be located in the build directory /doc/HTML with index.html
as main page.

# Pre-Certification / Validating the openSAFETY source files

See \ref sect_precertification for infomation on how to check the openSAFETY
source files for validity or modifications, respectively.
