The file xosddbining.py goes in this directory.
Since the creation of the file relies on the Python package "PyXB" and depends
on the used openSAFETY schema file, it cannot be shipped directly with the
source distribution. It has to be generated instead. See the documentation
on how to generate the xosddbining.py file.
